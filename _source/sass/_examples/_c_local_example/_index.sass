/** 
 *  @file _index.sass 
 *  @description  Loads all sass files or subdirectory indices in its directory.
 *  @directory Styles specific to the current project. Override a_core and b_application SASS where necessary.
 *
 *  Libraries: Use for mixins and SASS functions.
 *  Definitions: Use for common styling components ready for SASS @extension.
 *  Structure: Use for sitewide layout, including grid structure.
 *  Typography: Establish font styles, line heights and weights, with an emphasis on common element definitions. Future iterations may merge this with 40_elements below.
 *  Elements: Redefinitions of base HTML elements.
 *  Components: The heavy lifting. Define targeted styling here. Best practice is to use a structure germane to the application and matched to the template structure. That will make styles easier for others to find.
 *  Contexts: Styles pertinent to sections of a site or particular pages. For instance, you might define admin styling here, or a specific site page.
