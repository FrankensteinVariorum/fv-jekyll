Fittingly, this project began in November 2017, when we came together to discuss our shared awareness of the *Frankenstein* bicentennial and doing some work with the text. Scott Weingart pulled together a meeting in which we discussed how we might peform a digital collation, consider text analysis, and other opportunities. Our inital project began with Elisa Beshero-Bondar and Raffaele Viglianti looking at what could be used for collation, Matthew Lavin of the University of Pittsburgh and Scott looking at text analysis possibilities, Jon Klancher as a Romantacist was interested in online possibilities for annotations, and Rikk Mulligan in full text versions for analysis and the UI to make these accessible.

The scope of the project has shifted, with new pieces patched on and others cut and stitched as needed. Some of our original group had to shift their attention elsewhere, and with the aid of a Andrew W. Mellon Digital Humanities Seed Grant provided through the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, we had the resources to bring on graduate student collaborators for the annotation efforts. We also experimented with a GIS visualization component to the site.

The [**Agile Humanities Agency**](http://agilehumanities.ca/) is a firm based in Toronto whose members have extensive experience with Digital Humanities development, with particular expertise in digital editions. AH helped us develop a more professional look for our website and think through the interactivity of our edition reader and variorum interfaces. We also worked with them to resolve some of our unique navigation needs.
